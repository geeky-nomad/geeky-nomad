# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Prakash, a seasoned software engineer with 9+ years of experience in the software industry. Throughout my career, I have developed a strong proficiency in both backend frameworks and cloud technologies, as well as a deep understanding of data and AI/ML libraries. I am passionate about building efficient, scalable, and innovative solutions that drive business success.

## Technical Skills and Expertise

### Backend Frameworks
I have extensive experience working with several powerful web frameworks:
- **Starlette**: For building high-performance asyncio web applications.
- **Django**: For robust, high-level Python web development.
- **Flask**: For lightweight, microservices-oriented web applications.
- **FastAPI**: For modern, fast (high-performance) web applications with automatic interactive documentation.

### Data and AI/ML
My expertise extends to data engineering and machine learning, where I have worked on:
- Data analysis and processing using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
- Machine learning model development and deployment using libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn.
- Creation of intelligent chatbots utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Cloud Technologies
I have hands-on experience with major cloud platforms, enabling the deployment and management of scalable and reliable applications:
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: 
  - EC2 for scalable computing power.
  - S3 for object storage.
  - RDS for managed relational databases.
  - Lambda for serverless computing.
  - API Gateway for building and maintaining APIs.
  - DynamoDB for NoSQL databases.
  - Sagemaker for building, training, and deploying ML models.
- **GCP (Google Cloud Platform)**:
  - Compute Engine for virtual machines.
  - Cloud Storage for object storage.
  - BigQuery for data warehousing and analytics.
  - Cloud Functions for event-driven serverless computing.
  - Cloud Run for containerized applications.
  - AI Platform for end-to-end machine learning services.

### Protocols and Communication
I am well-versed in implementing and utilizing various protocols for communication between services:
- **gRPC**: For high-performance RPC framework.
- **REST**: For designing and interacting with RESTful APIs.
- **GraphQL**: For efficient data querying and manipulation.

### Other Technologies
- **Docker**: For containerization and creating reproducible environments.
- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration and managing deployments.
- **CI/CD**: Implementing continuous integration and deployment pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI.
